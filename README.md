=======================
A Ping-pong ranking app for Jane.com



Questions
-----------------


MVP Tasks
-----------------
- input # of games won and loss vs opponent
- if lesser person wins, they take their rank on list



Nice To Have
-----------------
- Bring in own font (googleapis REALLY slow sometimes)
- Add challenge button and about on hover states
- send Email on signup / Challenge press
- Both have to report the same outcome for it to be counted as good
- Implement "wager" feature
- Mass challenge for a Jane-wide tournament - telling you who you play next etc...
