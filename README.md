HTTP - Hacker Table Tennis Pals
=======================
A Ping-pong ranking app for Jane.com



Questions
-----------------
- I can get the POST of a score submittal to go just fine using express, but it always reloads the page.  When I try via ajax it puts the url up top.  Both are behaviors I want to remove, but how?
- How to write a new key:value pair to whole new collection
- How to write value to document and have data persist

MVP Tasks
-----------------
- input # of games won and loss vs opponent
- if lesser person wins, they take their rank on list



Nice To Have
-----------------
- Bring in own font (googleapis REALLY slow sometimes)
- Add challenge button and about on hover states
- send Email on signup / Challenge press
- Both have to report the same outcome for it to be counted as good
- Implement "wager" feature
- Mass challenge for a Jane-wide tournament - telling you who you play next etc...
