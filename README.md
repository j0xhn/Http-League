HTTP - Hacker Table Tennis Pals
=======================
A Ping-pong ranking app for Jane.com



Questions
-----------------
- Q-1 : How to transform mongoose 'query' into model - controllers/user.js line 42
- Q-2 : Save to a "matches" collection - controllers/user.js line 115
- Q-3 : How to make the server not do anything after processing all of this, always wants to redirect :(


MVP Tasks
-----------------
- input # of games won and loss vs opponent
- if lesser person wins, they take their rank on list



Nice To Have
-----------------
- Bring in own font (googleapis REALLY slow sometimes)
- Add challenge button and about on hover states
- send Email on signup / Challenge press
- Both have to report the same outcome for it to be counted as good
- Implement "wager" feature
- Mass challenge for a Jane-wide tournament - telling you who you play next etc...
