Http League - Hacker Table Tennis Pals
=======================
A Ping-pong ranking app for Jane.com and anyone who dare challenge her greatness.



For Business Games
-----------------
- Mobile Friendly with Search
- Email sent to challengers
- Challenge page setup to accept score / enter score OR only enter score for people you've played against.... I like having seperate game pages though




Nice To Have
-----------------
- Bring in own font (googleapis REALLY slow sometimes)
- Both have to report the same outcome for it to be counted as good
- Implement "wager" feature
- Mass challenge for a Jane-wide tournament - telling you who you play next etc...
